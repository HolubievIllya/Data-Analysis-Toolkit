# Data-Analysis-Toolkit
The code provides a collection of functions for various statistical calculations, including sorting, frequency analysis, mean calculations, and dispersion measures.
## About

<ul>
  <li>bubble_sort - sorts a list of elements in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm</li>
  <li>array_frequency - calculates the frequency of each unique element in a list and returns a dictionary with element-frequency pairs</li>
  <li>arithmetic_mean - computes the arithmetic mean (average) of a list of numbers</li>
  <li>harmonic_mean - calculates the harmonic mean of a list of numbers</li>
  <li>mean_square - computes the root mean square (RMS) of a list of numbers</li>
  <li>geometric_mean - calculates the geometric mean of a list of numbers</li>
  <li>mode - finds the mode(s), i.e., the most frequently occurring element(s), in a list</li>
  <li>median - computes the median</li>
  <li>range_of_variation - calculates the range of variation, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a list</li>
  <li>mean_deviation - computes the mean deviation of a list of numbers</li>
  <li>mean_squared_deviation - calculates the mean squared deviation of a list of numbers</li>
  <li>dispersion - computes the dispersion</li>
  <li>coefficient_of_variation -  calculates the coefficient of variation, which represents the relative variability of a list of numbers</li>
  <li>coefficient_of_oscillation - computes the coefficient of oscillation, which represents the relative amplitude of oscillations in a list of numbers</li>
  <li>covariance - calculates the covariance between two lists of numerical data, measuring their joint variability</li>
</ul>
You can utilize this code to perform various statistical calculations. Additionally, you have the flexibility to add your own custom calculation methods as needed.
